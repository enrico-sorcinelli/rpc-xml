RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.80

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = RPC::XML::Client->new(
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php' );
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = RPC::XML::Server->new( host => 'localhost',
                                     port => 9000 );
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

* etc/make_method
Make the build reproducible by dropping timestamps in
make_method output. (Niko Tyni)

* t/40_server.t
* t/40_server_xmllibxml.t
* t/50_client.t
Fixes for test problems with Strawberry Perl.

* lib/RPC/XML/Client.pm
Fix leak caused by failing to free Expat parser. We don't want
to return from the method until the parser's been freed. We
therefore need to call $parser->release() before the return
statements caused by request failures. (Tom Grimwood-Taylor)

* lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm
One socket-opt change, one typo corrected.

* lib/RPC/XML.pm
Applied patch for numeric regexes and critic cleanup. Addresses
GitHub pull request #10 and RT #111636.

* t/60_net_server.t
RT #99578: Work-around fix for Net::Server+IO::Socket::IP. If a
system's IPv6 declaration of localhost was before the IPv4
declaration in the hosts file, this test would fail.
